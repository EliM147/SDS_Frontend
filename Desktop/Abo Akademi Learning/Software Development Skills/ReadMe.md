Hello,

So in this short readme I should mention how the project works for the course.I think it is pretty straight forward: there are 4 pages present with the content about me as a professional, and links to different websites.Â 

The pages include info about me, my past projects, work experience, education. 

It is supported by SASS, has HTML, and a few of JavaScript. 

Otherwise, the website is hosted at iliamaslov.com, and is going to be overhauled over the oncoming month. 

Thanks for attention.
Kind regards,Ilia
